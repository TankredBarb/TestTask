This is a very simple Qt based HTTP server. It accepts connection on port 8081 and executes commands.

Available commands:

-/ - returns default html page with a commands list
-/ProcList - returns a list of running processes
-/ListDir - returns a list of files in working directory
-/Date - returns the current date

To test the server use the following url in your browser:
http://<your-ip>:8081/ - (http://192.168.0.105:8081/ - for example). 
You can also try this url with utilities like a curl

Server will return 404 Not Found for all non-supported commands.
Only HTTP GET method is supported.
